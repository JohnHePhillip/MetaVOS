## Pre Requisites

### STEP-1 Installing required libraries


### STEP-2 Downloading and preparing the dataset

**DAVIS-17**
Download the DAVIS-17 Train and Val dataset from (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/csergi/share/davis/DAVIS-2017-trainval-Full-Resolution.zip).
After downloading the dataset, extract it within the metavos directory.

**For your own dataset**


### STEP-3 Downloading the trained Model
The trained model for DAVIS-17 can be downloaded from (https://unioxfordnexus-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/engs1635_ox_ac_uk/Documents/research/segmentation/metavos_data/DAVIS_2017_prototypical_MODES_train_max_109000.pth?csf=1&e=VvEG1G).

After downloading the weights, please put it in the folder 'snapshots'
